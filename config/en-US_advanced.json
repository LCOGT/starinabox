The tracks that you see on the graph (on the left) map the lifecycle of the star. You can play the animation of the star moving around the diagram, and see how its luminosity, size, surface temperature, and mass change in the panels on the right.</p><p>Stars can take billions of years to go through their lives with the dramatic events taking place in relatively short periods of time. In the animation we speed up time when the star is not really changing much and slow things down for the dramatic phases of the star's life.</p><h3>Keyboard controls:</h3>%CONTROLLIST%<h3>Acknowledgments</h3><p><b>Design &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/zemogle/starinabox\">Development</a></b>: <a href=\"http://jyardley.co.uk\">Jon Yardley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.strudel.org.uk/\">Stuart Lowe</a>, <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/egomez\">Edward Gomez</a>, <a href=\"http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/?page=full&id=151\">Haley Gomez</a> &amp; Chris North</p><p>Supported by <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/\">LCOGT</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.cf.ac.uk/\">Cardiff University</a></p><p>Based on the stellar evolution research of <a href=\"http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~jhurley/\">Jarrod Hurley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.astro.ru.nl/wiki/general/people/onno_pols\">Onno Pols</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~cat/\">Christopher Tout</a></p>" },

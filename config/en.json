They can also lose mass through winds blowing off their surface and at dramatic moments in their lives.</p><p>Stars are massive so, rather than measure this in kilograms, we measure this in comparison to our Sun which has 1 Solar Mass - which is about 2 million million million million million kg!</p>",
			"rStopwatch": "<h2>Stages in your star's life</h2><p>This stopwatch shows the relative time the star spends in each stage of its life. In the animation we speed up time when the star is not really changing much and slow things down for the dramatic phases of the star's life.</p>",

			"thermometer": "<h2>Surface Temperature</h2><p>How the surface temperature of your star changes with time. The temperatures are given in Kelvin which is usually abbreviated to K. Remember that:</p><blockquote style=\"text-align:center;\">0&deg;C = 273 K</blockquote>",

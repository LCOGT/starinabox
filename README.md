Have you ever wondered what happens to the different stars in the night sky as they get older? This interactive web-app lets you explore the [life-cycle of stars](https://lco.global/book/life-cycle-stars).

Interactive life-cycle
----------------------

[Star in a Box is an interactive web-app](https://lco.global/siab/) which animates stars with different starting masses as they change during their lives. Some stars live fast-paced, dramatic lives, others change very little for billions of years. The web-app visualises the changes in mass, size, brightness and temperature for all these different stages.

Classroom resources
-------------------

Are you a teacher? Do you want to use Star in a Box in your classroom lessons? These resources are designed to help you to explore the life-cycle of stars with your class.

You can find all of our educational resources to accompany Star in a Box on the [Las Cumbres Observatory website](https://lco.global/education/activities/star-in-a-box/).

Translations
----

Star in a Box can handle multiple languages. The simplest way to translate this app is:
* Fill out the translation forms [normal](https://lco.global/siab/translate.html) and [advanced](https://lco.global/siab/translate_advanced.html),
* Copy the JSON output at the bottom of the page
* Then either email them to me (contact details on the translation page) or submit a pull request with the language file included.

Code
----

The code requires Javascript and SVG so you just need a modern web browser to use it.

Note that the Chrome browser has extra security when running locally. This stops Star in a Box getting the language or star property JS files. You will need to start Chrome with the option "--allow-file-access-from-files". On a Mac you can open a terminal and run:

    open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files

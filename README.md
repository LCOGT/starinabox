Star in a Box
=============

Have you ever wondered what happens to the different stars in the night sky as they get older? This interactive web-app lets you explore the life-cycle of stars.

Interactive life-cycle
----------------------

[Star in a Box is an interactive web-app](http://lcogt.net/siab/) which animates stars with different starting masses as they change during their lives. Some stars live fast-paced, dramatic lives, others change very little for billions of years. The web-app visualises the changes in mass, size, brightness and temperature for all these different stages.

Star in a Box
=============

Have you ever wondered what happens to the different stars in the night sky as they get older? This interactive web-app lets you explore the [life-cycle of stars](http://lcogt.net/book/life-cycle-stars).

Interactive life-cycle
----------------------

[Star in a Box is an interactive web-app](http://lcogt.net/siab/) which animates stars with different starting masses as they change during their lives. Some stars live fast-paced, dramatic lives, others change very little for billions of years. The web-app visualises the changes in mass, size, brightness and temperature for all these different stages.

Code
----

The code requires Javascript and SVG so you just need a modern web browser to use it.

Note that the Chrome browser has extra security when running locally. This stops Star in a Box getting the language or star property JS files. You will need to start Chrome with the option "--allow-file-access-from-files". On a Mac you can open a terminal and run:
    open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
